          The company transforms inventions to business by using insight into
          market needs, wherein the capacity to gain an accurate and deep
          understanding is backed by: Own patented thus standalone technology,
          advanced engineering spun from totally different subject disciplines,
          physics, mathematics, industrial design, market needs, business and
          market strategy, industrialization processes, mass production thus
          allied with strong externals partner(s) for execution.

        <p>
          For IPR security and markets strategy reasons, Telenostra neither
          reveals pictures, more information than listed here and any
          publications, nor wishes to update its website yet for the same
          reason.
        </p>

        <p>
          Telenostra (TN), unlike most contemporary companies, possesses its own
          inventions package and corresponding patents fostered in its own hefty
          patent factory which undeniably has a great global market need. TN has
          a dedicated and strong engineering team, alliance with selected
          production factories for each defined technology, components
          suppliers, and fully protected IPR’s according to the applicable laws.
          TN invests only in its own patent portfolio.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each invention must provide independent, disruptive solutions that
          will, as a direct result of their creation, spawn new ideas and
          technologies for a whole range of different industries, quite distinct
          from original purposes for which the inventions were devised. It is a
          characteristic of TN’s patented projects that their unique nature
          allows them to be utilized in multiple markets and used in many fields
          of exploitation above their original design purposes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each project that TN initiates must address a global market need and
          be perceived as paradigm change in any industry TN wishes to enter
          thus helpful for mankind. TN, as patent factory controlling product
          with huge market need, has invested, made, tested, and took a mammoth
          R&D risk, which has already fostered several ready potential
          “unicorns” to be transferred to a series of independent Special
          Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) companies. Each SPV will then hold its own
          intellectual property rights (IPR), market data, market need,
          ready-made business plan, mass production contract for the given
          product in each SPV. Each SPV will have its own CEO, marketing and
          sales force and board of directors assembled with the final investment
          partners, be it e.g. VC, Private equity or industrial/brands – then as
          part of several of TN’s exit strategies, - ally with industrial/brands
          that see the need for bigger growth and can fully buys out SPV or as
          part of possible IPO process.
        </p>
        <p>
          TN does not sell physical products directly, but in phase 1 it builds
          a given technology through all R&D risk phases, prototypes, testing,
          industrial design, IPR protection, finds the qualified production
          factories and the necessary tools needed as for “start-ups”, then
          transfers everything to a new, independent SPV. In phase 2, it finds
          the right market and sales team and, in parallel approach, a successor
          to initiate global sales, license or exit.
        </p>

        <p>Investors can only invest in TN’s SPV, but not in TN itself.</p>
