          Intragraph will replace todays obsolete Smartphones and Laptops, with

          Intragraph disposes of totally newly developed (by Telenostra),
          versatile Phone and Laptop which will set a new standard in the IT
          industry. As it can be extensively documented by means of patents,
          media, publishing, and the Internet over the last 15 years, the
          Smartphone and Laptop development, and their design have long ago
          reached their innovation peak. This situation is specifically
          characterized by the abundance of Apps and the predominance of
          publishing futuristic exterior designs, thus functions which have no
          roots in reality either improve any real user experience. The
          development within Smartphone and Laptop has in reality stopped, as
          the industry has forgotten the most important factors within the
          development phase, namely physics, mathematics and the countless
          market needs that require functions which Intergraph possesses.
        </p>
        <p>
          The development and the market as it looks today, are impossible to
          reverse, unless there is a paradigm shift in the way of thinking;
          until then it is impossible to perceive one’s own need. Therefore,
          Intragraph has patented, (via Telenostra), actual, versatile foldable
          Phone and Laptop devices having mechanical motion in the X, Y and Z
          system, that is a defined movement resulting applications of force.
          Having said that it means that for something being considered in
          motion, it must be moving in relation to something else.
        </p>

        <p>
          The mystery is how Intragraph’s versatile Phone and Laptop work, it
          is, impossible to imagine something from unknown base of reference,
          even if one presents the object’s function in precise written form,
          one will not, however, understand the object’s functions until it can
          be seen.
        </p>
        <p>
          In other words, Intragraph new versatile devices mean irreversible
          paradigm shift, in technique, software and structural design. These
          devices can be perceived as a systematic change in the way of
          thinking, thus in how one perceives pattern of irregular motion,
          construction, function, design and Human Machine Interface (HMI). The
          Intragraph versatile phone and laptop function opens a new era for
          totally new Apps and 3D games and will be an invaluable aid to mankind
          in many aspects.
        </p>

        <p>
          Therefore, the occurrence of paradigm shift is impossible to imagine
          without a concrete reference base. No matter how long one lives in the
          existing and the old worldview, one will not be able to relate to what
          the new is about to come. After the new has been properly introduced,
          however, one will not understand how one managed without this before.
          Difficulties in perceiving and understanding the new can be then a
          proof of the qualities and significant upheaval of the innovation.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is sufficient to mention, that user’s awareness of what our
          Intragraph versatile Phone and Laptop offers in terms of numerous user
          benefits, can actually make today’s Smartphones and Laptops obsolete.
          Even to an untrained eye, the current most modern phones and Laptops
          will look primitive and belonging to a previous generation.
